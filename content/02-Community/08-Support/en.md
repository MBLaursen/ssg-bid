# Community Support

This section describes the way the BID programme and the community participating in it support the preparation of high-quality project proposals and the successful implementation of funded projects. Check the items below if you are seeking options for collaboration, implementation advice or personalized help to solve a problem.

-----------

## Remote Support

The quickest and easiest way to request and provide support in BID is making use of the programme's online support mechanisms:

* Go to the **documentation area** to find recommended resources and a "Frequently Asked Questions" section based on previous interactions between community members:

 [Access the documentation area](../documentation/) 
 
* Get information about the **capacity enhancement workshops** organized by the programme globally:

 [Go to the capacity enhancement workshops section](../workshops/)

* Discuss online with fellow project contributors and mentors in the **BID mailing lists**. 

 [Get information about the BID mailing lists](../mailing-lists/)

-----------

## On-site Support

If you require extra help for a specific outreach or training event, or if you encounter substantial, unforeseen difficulties during the implementation phase of a project that cannot be solved through online support mechanisms, you will soon have the opportunity to apply for funds to support travelling and honorarium through an **on-site mentoring action**.
