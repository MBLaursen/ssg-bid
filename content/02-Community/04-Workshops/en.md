# Capacity Enhancement Workshops

The BID programme includes capacity enhancement workshops organised by the programme coordinator for each of the three target geographic areas (Sub-Saharan Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific). The objective of these workshops is “*to address potential capacity needs of project leads and their teams for project implementation*“. The workshops are planned for the start and mid-term of the implementation period of the funded projects.

In addition to ensuring that all project teams have at least the basic capacity required to implement their projects, the BID workshops will  provide the opportunity for project representatives to interact among themselves and with potential mentors and trainers.

The workshops will be organized with implementing partners in the target regions. They will be co-funded using BID funds, with support from the Secretariat and the implementing partners.

## How to participate in BID workshops

Participation in the BID-funded workshops is restricted to project representatives and mentors. The GBIF Secretariat issues specific calls for nominations among those entitled to send participants to a workshop during the workshop planning phase. Join the mentors' team or contact the leader of the BID project you collaborate with to explore options for participating in the next BID workshop.
