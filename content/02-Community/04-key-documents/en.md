# Key documents

Grantees can find project documents, like reporting templates and communications guidelines, as well as other materials providing useful guidance that supports their projects.

Reporting templates and other key materials for project grantees are available here.

## Instructions: Self-assessment for data-holding institutions

Grantees from the BID programme are expected to carry out self-assessments to assist with planning and monitoring progress.

**Recipients of national grants** should complete the [capacity self-assessment for national biodiversity information facilities](http://www.gbif.org/resource/82277) (also available [in French](http://www.gbif.org/resource/82782)). 

**Recipients of small and regional grants** should complete the [capacity self-assessment for data holding institutions](http://www.gbif.org/resource/82785) (also available [in French](http://www.gbif.org/resource/82813)). 

Grantees should complete the appropriate self-assessment at least twice during their project:

1. At the start of the project—to set a baseline and inform the design of the BID capacity enhancement workshops.
2. At the end of the project—preferably prior to submitting the final project report, since the assessment can provide some data for the project narrative. 

Institutions are welcome to streamline the self-assessment into their own monitoring and assessment processes. 

In addition, grantees can increase the frequency of the assessment to monitor progress and establish whether an institution's capacity is improving, deteriorating or is being maintained at a desirable level in a timely manner. This approach may be especially useful in gauging the longer term impact of a BID-funded  project if a self-assessment is also carried out, for example, in six months or one year after its conclusion. 

## Project reporting templates

Templates for narrative and financial reports on BID-funded activities will appear here when available.

## Knowledgebase

While GBIF.org maintains a [large collection of useful documentation](http://www.gbif.org/resources), the following are likely to be particularly relevant for BID grantees who are new to the GBIF Community.        

+ [Establishing an Effective GBIF Participant Node](http://www.gbif.org/resource/80925): also available in [français](http://www.gbif.org/resource/82147), [português](http://www.gbif.org/resource/82231) and [español](http://www.gbif.org/resource/82186)
+ [GBIF Capacity Enhancement Framework](http://www.gbif.org/resource/80954)
