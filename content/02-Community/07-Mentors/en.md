# Mentors

Mentors are a pillar of the BID community. They actively contribute their knowledge and expertise while collaborating directly with project teams. In return, they get unique access to opportunities for engaging other biodiversity informatics  experts and helping to establish or enhance biodiversity information facilities. Activities include participation in webinars, capacity enhancement workshops and networking opportunities with project team members and other partners. 

Those interested in joining the [current mentors](people#mentors) can review the [official call for BID mentors](/src/raw/Call-for-BID-volunteer-mentors.pdf), learn more about the role's benefits and responsibilities, or go directly to [the application form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1R3EmHdZxt6ZoTJ9e43SeOG7Rl3awNidaLN-pdmbCFZQ/viewform).

## Mailing list

Mentors can network and discuss problems and solutions that arise via the [BID mentor mailing list](http://lists.gbif.org/mailman/listinfo/bid-mentors). The GBIF Secretariat manages requests to join this private list.

-----------

## On-site mentoring actions

Working under agreements with project teams and the GBIF Secretariat, mentors can provide BID projects with face-to-face support. Financial support for such actions is available to cover mentors' travelling expenses and honoraria.
