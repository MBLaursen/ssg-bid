# Mentors' Area

Mentors are one of the two basic pillars of the BID community. The programme offer networking and capacity-related tools for the mentors to collaborate effectively with the project teams but also with other mentors. Have a look at our suggestions below.

-----------

## Mentors mailing list

The mentors mailing list is restricted to those who have taken that role in the BID community and provides a space for networking, double-checking solutions to problems raised in the general mailing list before sending an answer, etc.

To subscribe or access the archive of past conversations, use the mailing list administration interface following this link:

-----------

## Networking and training opportunities

Mentors have access to unique opportunities to engage with other experts in the field of biodiversity informatics and the establishment of biodiversity information facilities. This includes participating in webinars, capacity enhancement workshops and targeted networking opportunities with or without the involvement of project team representatives. 

The GBIF Secretariat will periodically announce opportunities for mentors through the mentor mailing list.

-----------

## Resources for mentors

The resources area include resources specifically designed for mentors and others leading capacity enhancement activities.

[Go to the resources area](http://bid.gbif.org/)

-----------

## Onsite support

Mentors can enter collaboration agreements with project teams and the GBIF Secretariat to provide face to face support to projects. The onsite mentoring actions system financially supports these collaborations by covering travelling expenses and honorarium for mentors. Check the onsite mentoring actions section to get the latest information on how to apply for this support.
