# Mailing lists and remote support

The BID programme includes several mechanisms for the members of its community to interact online. Currently most of the activity is built around the programme mailing lists but there are other options listed below. Please contact BID@gbif.org if you have trouble using any of the remote support mechanisms listed here.

-----------

## General community mailing list

The general mailing list is the best place to connect with other members of the community. Post your questions, suggestions, plans... and check what the others are doing and identify common interests.

To subscribe or access the archive of past conversations, use the mailing list administration interface accessible following this link:

[Access the general mailing list](http://lists.gbif.org/mailman/listinfo/bid-community)

-----------

## Mentors mailing list

The mentors mailing list is restricted to those who have taken this role in the BID community. It provides a space for networking, double-checking solutions to problems raised in the general mailing list before sending an answer, etc.

To subscribe or access the archive of past conversations, use the mailing list administration interface following this link:

## Other direct remote support mechanisms

The mailing lists are a perfect place to start contact with other members of the community, but sometimes they are not the best channel to address complicated issues. Fortunately, there are other easy-to-use remote mechanisms that can be used to continue collaborative work: 

 - Mentors can help to answer questions and directing project participants to further information and resources, using **direct conference calls, screen sharing or text chat** (e.g. using software like Skype or Google Hangouts).
 - Those with enough technical expertise can provide remote technical support and debugging by **accessing (or providing access to) remote servers.**
 - **Exchange files** via email can be enough to solve issues such as:
  - Hands-on support for data management and publishing issues, including checking the quality of (un)published datasets.
  -  Providing feedback on plans, agendas or resources linked to training activities organized by the project teams.
  - Reviewing draft mid-term and final narrative reports prepared by grantees ahead of their submission to the GBIF Secretariat.
