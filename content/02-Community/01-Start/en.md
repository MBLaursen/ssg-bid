# Community of Practice

The BID community of practice supports the preparation of high-quality project proposals and the successful implementation of funded projects. Check the options below if you are seeking options for collaboration, implementation advice or direct support to solve a problem.

-----------

## Remote Support

The first stop in the BID community is our remote support section. Please check the options below for online interaction and mutual support:

* Check the contents of our **knowledge base** and find documentation related to the issues you are experiencing contributed by the community:

 [Access the knowledge base](/community/knowledge-base/) 
* Get more information about the **capacity enhancement workshops** organized globally within the BID programme.

 [Go to the capacity enhancement workshops section](/community/workshops/)

* Discuss online with fellow project contributors and mentors in the general mailing list. 

 [Get information about the BID mailing lists](/community/forum/)

-----------

## Onsite Support

If you require additional help for an outreach or training event, or you encounter substantial, unforeseen difficulties during the implementation phase of a project that cannot be solved through online support mechanisms, you will soon have the opportunity to apply for funds to support travelling and honorarium through an **onsite mentoring action**.

[Get information on the upcoming onsite mentoring actions](community/mentoring/)

-----------

## Directory of Community Members

The directory of community members includes information on who is already actively involved in BID. Whether you are interested in finding project partners or career opportunities, the BID directory can help you.

[Access the directory](/community/directory/)

## Resources for Mentors
