# Community of Practice

The BID community of practice supports the preparation of high-quality project proposals and the successful implementation of funded projects. Check the options below if you are seeking options for collaboration, implementation advice or direct support to solve a problem.

## Remote Support

The first stop in the BID community is our remote support section. Please check the options below for online interaction and mutual support:

* Check the contents of our **knowledge base** and find documentation related to the issues you are experiencing contributed by the community:

 [Access the knowledge base](/community/knowledge-base/) 
* Get more information about the **capacity enhancement workshops** organized globally within the BID programme.

 [Go to the capacity enhancement workshops section](/community/workshops/)

* Discuss online with fellow project contributors and mentors in the general mailing list. 

 [Get information about the BID mailing lists](/community/forum/)

## Onsite Support

If you encounter substantial, unforeseen difficulties during the implementation or reporting phases of a project, or if you require additional support for an outreach or training event, you will soon have the opportunity to apply for funds to support travelling and honorarium through an onsite mentoring action. More information about this option will be available soon.
