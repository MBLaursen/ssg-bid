# Community Support

The BID programme and the community around it support the preparation of high-quality project proposals and the successful implementation of funded projects. Check the options below if you are seeking options for collaboration, implementation advice or direct support to solve a problem.

-----------

## Remote Support

The quickest and easiest way to request and provide community support is making use of the programme's online support mechanisms:

* Go to the **documentation area** to find recommended resources and a Frequently Asked Questions section based on previous interactions between community members:

 [Access the documentation area](/community/documentation/) 
* Get more information about the BID **capacity enhancement workshops** organized globally:

 [Go to the capacity enhancement workshops section](/community/workshops/)

* Discuss online with fellow project contributors and mentors in the general **mailing list**. 

 [Get information about the BID mailing lists](/community/forum/)

-----------

## Onsite Support

If you require additional help for a specific outreach or training event, or you encounter substantial, unforeseen difficulties during the implementation phase of a project that cannot be solved through online support mechanisms, you will soon have the opportunity to apply for funds to support travelling and honorarium through an **onsite mentoring action**.

## List of Community Members

The list of community members can help you whenever you are interested in finding project partners, opportunities as a mentor, or just want to know who is currently actively involved in BID. 

[Access the list of community members](/community/directory/)

## Resources for Mentors

BID mentors are voluntary contributors to the community of practice. Becoming a mentor, you will gain access to unique networking and training opportunities. Find out more about these opportunities and interact with fellow mentors in the mentors' area.
