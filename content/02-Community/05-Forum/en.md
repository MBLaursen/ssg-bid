# Mailing lists and remote support

The BID programme includes several mechanisms for the member of its community to interact online. Currently, all activity is built around the mailing lists described below and should be the reference mechanism to refer to, but there are other options also listed below.

-----------

## General community mailing list

The general mailing list is the place where you can connect with other members of the community. Post your questions, suggestions, plans... and check what the others are doing for points in common.

To subscribe or access the archive of past conversations, use the mailing list administration interface following this link:

-----------

## Mentors mailing list

The mentors mailing list is restricted to those who have taken that role in the BID community and provides a space for networking, double-checking solutions to problems raised in the general mailing list before sending an answer, etc.

To subscribe or access the archive of past conversations, use the mailing list administration interface following this link:

## Other direct remote support mechanisms

The mailing lists are a perfect place to start contact with other members of the community, but sometimes it is not the best channel to address complicated issues. Fortunately, there are other handy remote mechanisms that can be used to continue collaborative work: 

 - Mentors can help to answer questions and directing project participants to further information and resources, using **direct conference calls, screen sharing or text chat** (e.g. using software like Skype or Google Hangouts).
 - Those with enough technical expertise can providing remote technical support and debugging by **accessing (or providing access to) remote servers.**
 - **Exchange files** via email can be enough to solve issues such as:
  - Hands-on support for data management and publishing issues, including checking the quality of (un)published datasets.
  -  Providing feedback on plans, agendas or resources linked to training activities organized by the project teams.
  - Reviewing draft mid-term and final narrative reports prepared by grantees ahead of their submission to the GBIF Secretariat.
