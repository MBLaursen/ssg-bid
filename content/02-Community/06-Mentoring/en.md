# Onsite Mentoring Actions

Sometimes during the implementation of BID projects, unexpected challenges require additional efforts in terms of outreach or training. Sometimes it is not possible to solve a specially complicated issue through online mechanisms. In cases like those is where the upcoming onsite mentoring actions come into play. 

Onsite mentoring actions will provide the framework for co-funding travel expenses and honorarium for one of the mentors to meet in person with the project teams, work to address a specific issue or support a specific event, and ensure that they develop the capacity to solve similar situations in the future. 

The current plan includes issuing an open call for onsite mentoring actions in **August 2016** that will remain active throughout the BID projects implementation phase. Keep yourself informed about this opportunity and other interesting BIF news through [the general BID mailing list](/about/contact/).
