# Welcome!

The BID community relies on the expertise residing in the GBIF network to support successful implementation of [projects funded by the programme](http://www.gbif.org/programme/bid/all-projects).

BID grantees communicate with each other, as well as mentors, Secretariat staff and others from the GBIF network, through a [public mailing list](../mailing-list) that provides an open forum for discussion and problem-solving. They can gain access to [Key documents](../key-documents) like reporting templates, communications guidelines and other relevant materials to support their BID-funded projects. 

Community members also come together for [workshops](../workshops), mentoring and other networking opportunities intended to create lasting collaborations and enrich the skills and careers of all involved. 

[The people of the BID community](../people) are biodiversity informatics practitioners committed to open and transparency in biodiversity data around the world.
