# National grants

_Sub-Saharan Africa, 2015 (closed)_

National grants under the BID programme seek to establish or strengthen national biodiversity information facilities and to increase the biodiversity data available about the country to respond to national priorities.

-----------

## Submission procedure

**NOTE: The open call for submissions is now closed**

The deadline for submitting initial concept notes from sub-Saharan Africa was 20 November 2015. GBIF and the BID evaluation panel have provided feedback and recommendations to applicants invited to prepare full proposals.

Full proposals are due xx Feb 2016, and GBIF will announce the selected projects in March/April 2016.

**Applications must be submitted in English.** If you have particular difficulties in fulfilling this condition, contact [BID@gbif.org](mailto: bid@gbif.org) to get help as soon as possible and before xx January 2016.

Applications received late or incomplete will not be reviewed by the evaluation panel.

-----------

## General recommendations on preparing national grant proposals

+ **Ensure that your project meets the eligibility criteria and aligns well with the overall objectives for the fund.** Consider the evaluation criteria that the evaluation panel will use to assess your proposal.

+ **Be brief.** Try to provide the shortest responses possible and only add background information if really needed, using links to external resources rather than long explanations.
+ **Prepare your submissions in English.** The evaluation panel will use English as their working language and therefore applicants are requested to make submissions in English. Remember that if you have particular difficulties with this requirement, contact [BID@gbif.org](mailto:bid@gbif.org) for support as early as possible, and before xx January 2016.
+ **Review the [FAQ](faq).** This will be updated frequently during the project application period. Send any unanswered questions to [BID@gbif.org](mailto:bid@gbif.org).
+ **Submit as early as possible to avoid problems.** Early submission will give a chance for some follow-up to resolve any issues that arise ahead of the deadline. The deadline for submissions is a hard deadline, and projects received late or that are incomplete will not be reviewed by the evaluation panel.

## Objectives

The objectives of the BID national biodiversity data mobilization grants are to:
+ Establish or strengthen national biodiversity information facilities
+ Increase available biodiversity data, within and beyond the grant period
+ Apply biodiversity data in response to national priorities

The overall BID programme targets two key outcomes:
1. Enhanced capacity for effective mobilization and use of biodiversity information
2. Enhanced availability of information resources and best practice guidance for mobilization and application of biodiversity information for key policy needs

## Eligibility criteria

In addition to complying with the general eligibility criteria for [2015 call for Africa](africa-2015), applications for national biodiversity data mobilization grants must comply with the following criteria:

1. All projects must include activities contributing to each of the three component categories:
	+ Capacity enhancement of national biodiversity information facilities.
	+ Activities to mobilize biodiversity data.
	+ Integrating biodiversity information into policy and decision-making processes.
2. Applications must be submitted by the project coordinator that will coordinate the project activities on behalf of the project partners. The project coordinator must be a legal entity from an African ACP country (see [Annex A, Section 1](http://www.gbif.org/sites/default/files/gbif_project/files/BID-call-for-proposals-Annex-A.pdf)). The project coordinator will be responsible for managing the grant and for the project reporting.
3. Applications must include at least two relevant national institutes, agencies or non-governmental organizations as project partners.
4. Projects must involve users of biodiversity data as project partners, such as scientists, policy and decision-makers. These must be representatives of legal entities located in an African ACP country (see [Annex A, Section 2 + 3](http://www.gbif.org/sites/default/files/gbif_project/files/BID-call-for-proposals-Annex-A.pdf).
5. All confirmed project partners must be copied when concept notes and full proposals are submitted. Letters of support from confirmed project partners should be included as attachments to email submissions of project applications.
6. All projects must include a major component of data mobilization through the GBIF network. It is expected that most BID funding is directed towards data mobilization. As a guideline for the national grants, the amount of BID funding spent on data mobilization activities should not be less than 60% of the total grant.
7. BID funds may be used to cover up to 50% of the costs of any IT services or purchases, up to a maximum of €2,500 of any national grant. Receipts will need to be provided in financial reports.

-----------

## Evaluation criteria

Proposals will be assessed using the following criteria:

1. Alignment of the project with BID objectives and priorities.
2. Alignment of the project with clearly stated needs for biodiversity information and capacity development within the proposal.
3. The project’s complementary contributions to regional data needs, including those stated in the [Africa Rising declaration and action plan](http://www.gbif.org/sites/default/files/gbif_event/files/AfricaRising-Declaration-EN.pdf).
4. Demonstrated success and past experience delivering similar projects by the applicants.
5. Likelihood that the project will provide examples of best practice in the application of biodiversity information in decision-making.
6. Quantity, quality and relevance of the biodiversity data proposed for mobilization, with preference given to projects that mobilize biodiversity data relating to protected areas, threatened species and invasive alien species.
7. Strength of the plans to develop and sustain national capacity after the project actions.
8. Level of national support and cost-effectiveness of the proposed actions; the balance between the level of funding requested from BID and the cofunding contributed by the project partners.
9. Anticipated value of the project deliverables to both the national context and the broader GBIF community.
10. Choice and diversity of project partners, with preference given to projects that have the confirmed involvement of a diverse network of data holders and data users.
11. Quality of project design and risk assessment; monitoring and evaluation plans will be assessed in the full proposals.

-----------

## Project duration

Selected projects may begin their activities in June 2016, with project activity continuing for up to two years (ending in June 2018), and with a final six-month reporting and evaluation period (ending in December 2018). All projects must end by 31 December 2018.

-----------

## Funding

Up to €60,000 per national grant. During the course of the BID programme, the maximum total project funding that any single applicant can receive is €60,000.


### National grant activity types

National grants must include at least one activity contributing to each of three component categories. Each category presented below includes a non-exclusive list of possible types of activity:

**1. Capacity enhancement of national biodiversity information facilities**
+ Assessing biodiversity data holdings and user needs through a survey or study
+ Developing a strategic plan for the biodiversity information facility
+ Organizing national stakeholders’ workshops to engage the community of biodiversity data holders and users
+ Formalizing partnerships through institutional agreements, data sharing policies and public endorsement of mobilization strategies
+ Establishing governance structures for the biodiversity information facilities (including representation from ministries, key institutions holding or using biodiversity data, etc.)
+ Setting up an infrastructure for the biodiversity information facility to support data publishing and management
+ Training stakeholders on data mobilization and management, for example, through workshops to share the knowledge gained through attending the two BID capacity enhancement workshops

**2. Activities to mobilize biodiversity data**
+ Compiling inventories of biodiversity data holdings (for example, implementing metadata catalogues)
+ Digitizing and publishing natural history collections and biodiversity information from literature
+ Mobilizing species occurrence and sample-based data from observation networks and monitoring systems, such as invasive alien species, Red Listed species or endemic species
+ Validating and publishing regional, national and local species checklists, invasive species lists or threatened species lists
+ Preparing [data papers](http://www.gbif.org/publishing-data/data-papers) to improve the reusability of the mobilized biodiversity data

**3. Integrating biodiversity information into policy and decision-making processes**
+ Leading surveys or workshops to understand the biodiversity data requirements for specific use cases.
+ Setting up user groups to guide project implementation on identified priority themes, such as agrobiodiversity, urban biodiversity and protected areas.
+ Directing workshops and advocacy actions that promote the use of openly accessible data, for example, in national-level biodiversity reporting.
+ Hosting workshops on data analysis techniques.
+ Applying biodiversity data in decision-making processes.
+ Documenting use cases and sharing them with partners in the region.
