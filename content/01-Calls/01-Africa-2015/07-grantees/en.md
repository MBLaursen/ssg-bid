### Instructions: Self-assessment for data-holding institutions

Grantees from the BID programme are expected to carry out a self-assessment on their institutional data holdings to help them develop their capacity to mobilize, manage and share data. 

**Recipients of national grants** should complete the [capacity self-assessment for national biodiversity information facilities](http://www.gbif.org/resource/82277) (also available [in French](http://www.gbif.org/resource/82782)). 

**Recipients of small and regional grants** should complete the [capacity self-assessment for data holding institutions](http://www.gbif.org/resource/82785) (French translation to follow soon). 

Grantees should complete the appropriate self-assessment at least three times during their project:

1. Within three months of the start of the project
2. At the project’s midterm
3. At the end of the project—preferably prior to submitting the final project report, since the assessment can provide some data for the project narrative. 

Institutions are welcome to streamline the self-assessment into their own monitoring and assessment processes. 

In addition, grantees can increase the frequency of the assessment to monitor progress and establish whether an institution's capacity is improving, deteriorating or is being maintained at a desirable level in a timely manner. This approach may be especially useful in gauging the longer term impact of a BID-funded  project if a self-assessment is also carried out, for example, in six months or one year after its conclusion.
