+ Use and extend best practices for digitizing natural history collections and mobilizing other biodiversity data
+ Apply biodiversity data in support of decision-making and research
+ Develop lasting national, regional or thematic networks to support ongoing data sharing and reuse

The call offers support for three grant types

A second and final call for proposals to support countries in sub-Saharan Africa is planned for 2017. Learn more about current [eligibility requirements](about/eligibility).
