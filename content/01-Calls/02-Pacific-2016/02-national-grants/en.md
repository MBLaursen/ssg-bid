# National grants

_Pacific, 2016_

National grants under the BID programme seek to establish or strengthen national biodiversity information facilities and to increase the biodiversity data available about the country to respond to national priorities.

-----------

## Submission procedure

The deadline for submitting initial concept notes from the Pacific Islands is 10 November 2016. 

GBIF and the BID evaluation panel will review concept notes and offer feedback and recommendations to applicants invited to prepare full proposals.

Full proposals will be due 9 Feb 2017, 12:00 pm CET / 11:00 am UTC/GMT, and GBIF will announce the selected projects by May 2017.

**Applications must be submitted in English and by using the appropriate template**.

Applications received late or incomplete will not be reviewed by the evaluation panel.

-----------

## Objectives

The objectives of the BID national biodiversity data mobilization grants are to:
+ Establish or strengthen national biodiversity information facilities
+ Increase available biodiversity data, within and beyond the grant period
+ Apply biodiversity data in response to national priorities

The overall BID programme targets two key outcomes:
1. Enhanced capacity for effective mobilization and use of biodiversity information
2. Enhanced availability of information resources and best practice guidance for mobilization and application of biodiversity information for key policy needs

+ Template for full proposals: *coming soon*

## Evaluation criteria

Proposals will be assessed using the following criteria:

1. Alignment of the project with BID objectives and priorities.
2. Alignment of the project with clearly stated needs for biodiversity information and capacity development within the proposal.
3. The project’s complementary contributions to regional data needs.
4. Demonstrated success and past experience delivering similar projects by the applicants.
5. Likelihood that the project will provide examples of best practice in the application of biodiversity information in decision-making.
6. Quantity, quality and relevance of the biodiversity data proposed for mobilization, with preference given to projects that mobilize biodiversity data relating to protected areas, threatened species and invasive alien species.
7. Strength of the plans to develop and sustain national capacity after the project actions.
8. Level of national support and cost-effectiveness of the proposed actions; the balance between the level of funding requested from BID and the cofunding contributed by the project partners.
9. Anticipated value of the project deliverables to both the national context and the broader GBIF community.
10. Choice and diversity of project partners, with preference given to projects that have the confirmed involvement of a diverse network of data holders and data users.
11. Quality of project design and risk assessment; monitoring and evaluation plans will be assessed in the full proposals.

-----------

## Project duration

Selected projects may begin their activities in May 2017, with project activity continuing for up to 18 months (ending in November 2018), and with a final six-month reporting and evaluation period (ending in April 2019). All projects must end by 30 April 2019.

-----------

## Funding

Up to €60,000 per national grant. During the course of the BID programme, the maximum total project funding that any single applicant can receive is €60,000.

### National grant activity types

National grants must include at least one activity contributing to each of three component categories. Each category presented below includes a non-exclusive list of possible types of activity:

**1. Capacity enhancement of national biodiversity information facilities**
+ Assessing biodiversity data holdings and user needs through a survey or study
+ Developing a strategic plan for the biodiversity information facility
+ Organizing national stakeholders’ workshops to engage the community of biodiversity data holders and users
+ Formalizing partnerships through institutional agreements, data sharing policies and public endorsement of mobilization strategies
+ Establishing governance structures for the biodiversity information facilities (including representation from ministries, key institutions holding or using biodiversity data, etc.)
+ Setting up an infrastructure for the biodiversity information facility to support data publishing and management
+ Training stakeholders on data mobilization and management, for example, through workshops to share the knowledge gained through attending the two BID capacity enhancement workshops

**2. Activities to mobilize biodiversity data**
+ Compiling inventories of biodiversity data holdings (for example, implementing metadata catalogues)
+ Digitizing and publishing natural history collections and biodiversity information from literature
+ Mobilizing species occurrence and sample-based data from observation networks and monitoring systems, such as invasive alien species, Red Listed species or endemic species
+ Validating and publishing regional, national and local species checklists, invasive species lists or threatened species lists
+ Preparing [data papers](http://www.gbif.org/publishing-data/data-papers) to improve the reusability of the mobilized biodiversity data

**3. Integrating biodiversity information into policy and decision-making processes**
+ Leading surveys or workshops to understand the biodiversity data requirements for specific use cases.
+ Setting up user groups to guide project implementation on identified priority themes, such as agrobiodiversity, urban biodiversity and protected areas.
+ Directing workshops and advocacy actions that promote the use of openly accessible data, for example, in national-level biodiversity reporting.
+ Hosting workshops on data analysis techniques.
+ Applying biodiversity data in decision-making processes.
+ Documenting use cases and sharing them with partners in the region.
