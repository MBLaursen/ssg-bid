# What is BID?

_BID: **Biodiversity Information for Development**_

Biodiversity Information for Development, or BID, is a multi-year, €3.9 million programme funded by the [European Union](http://europa.eu) and led by GBIF with the aim of increasing the amount of biodiversity information available in the [‘ACP’ nations of sub-Saharan Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific](https://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/regions/african-caribbean-and-pacific-acp-region_en).

Funding from BID will support capacity enhancement activities and projects to mobilize biodiversity data and strengthen national or regional biodiversity information facilities in these regions. BID will focus on data that supports policy needs in the region, particularly in connection with protected areas, threatened species and invasive alien species.

BID kicked off in Africa in May 2015 at [Africa Rising](http://www.gbif.org/event/78473/ 'Africa Rising'), a conference hosted by SANBI, GBIF's Participant in South Africa.

## Project stakeholders
Making biodiversity information more readily available for specific policy-relevant purposes will benefit a large range of stakeholders both within and beyond the project’s regions, among them:

**Decision makers** from national ministries, national government authorities, and national and regional institutions responsible for the sustainable development and management of biological resources and for commitments to intergovernmental science-policy initiatives

**Data holders** who serve as the custodians and owners of biodiversity data, including natural history collection curators and scientists, field biologists, scientific researchers, private-sector practitioners and consultants, and citizen scientists



## Key project outcomes
+ Enhanced capacity for effective mobilization and use of biodiversity information
+ Improved enabling environment for collaborative mobilisation of targeted biodiversity data in each of the three target regions
+ Enhanced capacities of key stakeholders for coordinating the mobilization, management and use of targeted biodiversity data and establishing biodiversity information systems and networks, through the concept of training the trainers
+ A strengthened community of practice supporting the implementation of funded projects
+ Enhanced availability of information resources and best practice guidance for mobilisation and application of biodiversity information for key policy needs
+ Partnerships between key holders and users of biodiversity data are established or strengthened through consortia or biodiversity information systems and networks
+ Targeted biodiversity data mobilized in each of the regions
+ The use of the mobilized biodiversity data promoted through engagement with the scientific and policy communities
+ Identification and analysis of examples of the use of targeted biodiversity information in decision-making
+ Achievements of project interventions recognized by international science-policy initiatives
