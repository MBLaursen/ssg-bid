# Biodiversity Information for Development

Biodiversity Information for Development (BID) is a multi-year, €3.9 million programme funded by the [European Union](http://europa.eu) and led by GBIF with the aim of increasing the amount of biodiversity information available in the [‘ACP’ nations of sub-Saharan Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific](https://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/regions/african-caribbean-and-pacific-acp-region_en).

The deadline for submitting initial concept notes from sub-Saharan Africa was 20 November 2015. GBIF and the BID evaluation panel have provided feedback and recommendations to applicants invited to prepare full proposals. Those proposals are due xx Feb 2016, and GBIF will announce the selected projects in March/April 2016.

If you have been invited to submit a full proposal, find complete information about grant types here:

+ [National grants](/en/calls/africa-2015/national-grants)
+ [Small grants](/en/calls/africa-2015/small-grants)

GBIF will issue calls for proposals from [ACP countries](https://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/regions/african-caribbean-and-pacific-acp-region_en) in the Caribbean and Pacific Islands during Q2 of 2016, with a second and final call for Africa ACP countries planned in 2017.
