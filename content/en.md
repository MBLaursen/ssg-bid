BID: Biodiversity Information for Development
===================

Biodiversity Information for Development (BID) is a multi-year, €3.9 million programme funded by the [European Union](http://europa.eu) and led by GBIF with the aim of increasing the amount of biodiversity information available in the [‘ACP’ nations of sub-Saharan Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific](https://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/regions/african-caribbean-and-pacific-acp-region_en).

GBIF will announce the selection of projects from the first round of proposal submissions from sub-Saharan Africa in April 2016.

GBIF will issue calls for proposals in the Caribbean and Pacific Islands during Q2 of 2016, with a second and final call for Africa ACP countries planned in 2017.
