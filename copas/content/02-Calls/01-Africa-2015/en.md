# Call for proposals – Sub-Saharan Africa, 2015

**NOTE: The open call for submissions is now closed**

The deadline for submitting initial concept notes from sub-Saharan Africa was 20 November 2015. GBIF and the BID evaluation panel have provided feedback and recommendations to applicants invited to prepare full proposals.

Full proposals are due xx Feb 2016, and GBIF will announce the selected projects in March/April 2016.

This call will support projects from sub-Saharan Africa that:

+ Mobilize biodiversity data relating to protected areas, threatened species, and invasive alien species
+ Use and extend best practices for digitizing natural history collections and mobilizing other biodiversity data
+ Apply biodiversity data in support of decision-making and research
+ Develop lasting national, regional or thematic networks to support ongoing data sharing and reuse

## General eligibility criteria

All applications for BID grants must comply with the following general eligibility criteria:

1. Complete concept notes and full proposals in English must be received by the stated deadlines.
2. All confirmed project partners must have completed [one of the BID surveys](http://www.gbif.org/news/surveys-for-data-holders-decision-makers). These surveys are aimed at decision-makers and biodiversity data holders in the African ACP countries and seek to understand biodiversity data needs and resources in the region
3. Applicants must be legal entities located in an African ACP country (see [Annex A, Section 1](http://www.gbif.org/sites/default/files/gbif_project/files/BID-call-for-proposals-Annex-A.pdf)). Such entities include national government agencies, GBIF Participant nodes, natural history museums and collections, research institutes, universities, and NGOs.
4. Applications involving partners from countries or organizations that already participate in GBIF must include a statement of endorsement from the GBIF Head of Delegation or Node Manager. Contact information for representatives of GBIF Participant countries and organizations can be found on the Participant pages linked from the [Participant list](http://www.gbif.org/participation/participant-list).
All BID funded activities must be not-for-profit. BID programme funds may be used to support staff time, travel and costs associated with the organization of meetings and workshops, and limited costs for IT services and equipment.
6. Overhead costs may not be charged to BID grants.
7. Applicants must commit cofunding (in-kind or cash) to their projects and provide details of this cofunding in their concept notes and full proposals. Cofunding refers to real costs that are incurred by the applicants while executing the funded project’s activities. These could be in-kind contributions that directly contribute to the project activities (like staff salaries, travel costs etc.) or any in-cash contributions to BID activities from other funding sources.
8. All proposed project activities must fall within the stated implementation periods for each grant type.
9. Applicants must provide plans to ensure sustainability of activities after project support from BID concludes.
10. All data mobilized through the BID grants, as well as any other products of the projects, such as training material, must be made available under a [CC-BY license or CC0 license](http://www.gbif.org/newsroom/news/data-licensing-and-endorsement).
